# Work

I’m driven by tangible results and real-world impact, and I feel fortunate to have been able to explore a variety of interests along the way. Below I’ve collected some projects I’ve completed across courses, internships, and my spare time that best capture my academic interests, skills, and passions.

## Highlights {#highlights}

{:.list-arrows}
- {% include lbl-now.html %} **Built and led the Data Analytics desk within the Yale Daily News**, recruiting 15 members in its first year, setting up a technical stack (`R`, `D3.js`, `Tableau`), preparing documentation and technical guides, coordinating with the YDN's management and content teams, and guiding data reporters as they clean, analyze, visualize, and tell stories about data. More importantly, we're building support for data-driven journalism and interactive multimedia within the YDN.

- **Prototyped dashboards to unify multiple streams of customer feedback data at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and automate monthly reporting**, using a modular framework that ties in data from Twitter, Google Analytics, web feedback systems, and internal databases. Along the way, I analyzed web traffic data from Google Analytics, built stakeholder support for unified reporting processes, and defined a roadmap for future development. I used `R Shiny`, with natural language processing applications in `spaCy` integrated via `reticulate`. For summer 2019 internship as a [**Civic Digital Fellow**](https://blog.codingitforward.com/meet-the-2019-fellows-bureau-of-labor-statistics-db727bd7edfc){:target="_blank"}. [Slides](https://github.com/codingitforward/cdfdemoday2019/blob/master/Integrating_Multiple_Sources_of_Customer_Feedback_Data.pdf){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}
- **Created dashboards using crowdsourced Waze data to help Louisville visualize traffic patterns, pinpoint congestion points, target signaling changes, measure the impact of those changes, and make recommendations to policymakers**. This would save the city tens of thousands of dollars from not having to hire outside engineering firms to conduct the same analysis. I completed this work as part of my summer 2018 internship at Louisville's Office of Civic Innovation, using a combination of `AWS`, `SQL`, `R`, and `Microsoft Power BI`.

## Statistics & data science {#data-science}

{: .list-plus}
- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether using photos in text messages increases link click-through rates, with implications for text message marketing. We found no significant effect of including a picture versus not including one. We used `Twilio` (via Python API) to send SMS messages, `Rebrandly` (via Python API) to generate unique trackable links, and `R` for analysis and visualization. Final project for S&DS 315: Measuring Impact, Prof. Josh Kalla.

- **Analyzed Yale student body survey results on grading systems during the COVID-19 pandemic**, comparing student support for Universal Pass versus Optional Pass/Fail and assessing barriers that students face at home. For Yale College Council. [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltuBAJO32H4yhcteUkkrn4tuyvTjW2lu/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-page"}
- **Applied natural language processing on news articles to track the US-China trade war**. We scraped White House press releases and Chinese state media articles in order to apply sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling, demonstrating that sentiment often moves in tandem with key developments in the trade war. Used `selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` in Python for scraping, `dplyr` and `ggplot2` in R for analysis and visualization, and `topicmodels` in R for topic modeling. Final project for GLBL 849: Big Data & Global Policy, Prof. Casey King. [GitHub](https://github.com/iamdanzhao/maketradenotwar){:target="_blank" class="button inline-label-github"}

Along the way, I've gained in-depth experience with `R` and the `tidyverse`, including deep knowledge of `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `ggplot2`, and `purrr`, as well as applications in modeling, natural language processing, and mapping/GIS. On the Python side, I'm proficient in web scraping using whatever tool gets the job done (either `requests`, `selenium`, `BeautifulSoup`, or a combination), working with APIs, and machine learning. I'm also proficient with `D3.js`, Stata, Tableau, `R Shiny`, and `SQL`.

I've attempted to document all of this by creating reference guides for what I've learned. They're incomplete and I'm constantly adding to them, but perhaps they'll be useful:

## Policy & social science {#social-science}

{: .list-plus}
- Helped write a report on how to **bring young civic technologists into the public sector** by creating a student loan forgiveness program, a proven model in other fields [Report on inspire2serve.gov](https://inspire2serve.gov/_api/files/343){: class="button inline-label-page" target="_blank"} [Website](https://picturegrants.org/){: class="button inline-label-page" target="_blank"}
- **Led a team of 10 to research the Connecticut Green Bank, a public-private investment bank that funds renewable energy projects** in Connecticut and the nation's first of its kind. We focused on the relationship between its investment model and its shift towards equitable access to green energy, and present challenges in the face of Connecticut's budgetary challenges.
- Wrote a brief for **Mikie Sherrill's congressional campaign in NJ-11** regarding **reversing decades of environmental mismanagement on the Passaic River**, including how to hold chemical polluters accountable and enact more equitable flood insurance policy

In addition, I've also used **final projects and essays** in several courses as an opportunity to learn more about specific issues I'm interested in, such as:

{: .list-plus}
- **How Western technology companies facilitate digital authoritarianism by selling surveillance products**, acquiescing to China and Russia's demands, and letting misinformation go unchecked, as well as key considerations for developing policy moving forward
- **Whether cyberwarfare will require a fundamental reframing of our understanding of national security** (my take: it won't), and breaking down the key components of the "cyber revolution" hypothesis
- **The potential for algorithmic bias in Sidewalk Labs' proposal for a smart city in Toronto**, how that bias would harm vulnerable populations, and how algorithmic oversight boards can help mitigate these harms
- **The debate over the European Union Copyright Directive**, including an analysis of how key tradeoffs and incentives differ among technology companies, news organizations, and EU regulators. Includes sentiment analysis of tweets from American and European users.

- **How the urban built environment can impact residential segregation**, along with a framework, data sources, and methodology that we can use to study this relationship in New York City
- **How to increase interoperability of electronic health records (EHRs)** in the United States in order to facilitate big data in drug research, precision medicine and patient-centered care

These are **notes I've compiled for courses I've taken**, as a study and review tool. Feel free to use at your own discretion, although I make no guarantees for the accuracy of the notes or the degree to which they will represent the course as taught in future semesters.

- Current as of December 2018, but Delta has since designated Boston (BOS) as a hub, and established focus city operations Austin (AUS), Nashville (BNA), and San Jose (SJC). Of course, all of this is up in the air because nobody knows what will happen post-coronavirus.
