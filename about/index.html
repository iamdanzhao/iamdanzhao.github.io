        <h1>Hi, I'm <span class="blue">Daniel</span> ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <h2>I'm passionate about tech policy, politics, civic tech, data visualization, public transit, and the future of cities. I believe that public institutions need to play a key role in addressing many of society's most pressing challenges. And, despite being a statistics major, I believe that numbers seldom capture the entire story.</h2>
        <h2>One of my ongoing personal goals is to more deeply understand the factors that have influenced my worldview, to construct a narrative of the hundreds of people, events, moments, and experiences that have shaped my beliefs. You'll find below a short version of that story â€” at least as it pertains to my professional interests â€” below.</h2>

    <h2>My backstory</h2>
    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been a logical, numbers-driven person. I would make spreadsheets for things that didn't need spreadsheets, including my wishlist to Santa one year. But the more I dabbled into debate and politics, the more I saw  that there's a lot more to our society than just numbers and equations. The 2016 election, and the subsequent debates on healthcare and immigration, fascinated me as much as it instilled in me a belief that public policy remains one of the most direct, impactful ways to improve people's everyday livelihoods.</p>
    <p>So for a long time, I held independent interests in both technology and government. In 2018, however, my internship in Louisvilleâ€™s Office of Civic Innovation exposed me to the rapidly expanding field of civic technology. I saw first-hand how data and technology could unlock efficiencies in government by using crowdsourced Waze data to analyze traffic patterns, installing Wi-Fi sensors to predict vacant property fires that could ravage already-impoverished communities, and promoting awareness of low-cost internet plans offered by broadband providers. I believed that the way our government works was about to be revolutionized by technology â€” that technology would become the most effective way to fix service delivery, improve public policy, and impact lives.</p>
    <p>That perspective guided my next few pursuits. It led me to the Civic Digital Fellowship, an internship program for technical students to help modernize federal agencies, and, when the real-world harms of social media became apparent, it led me to believe that I could help solve problems of misinformation and content moderation as a data scientist at Facebook.</p>
    <p>My internship at Facebook started on May 26, 2020, just one day following the death of George Floyd. That summer, and events since then, have reshaped how I view technologyâ€™s role in society. Simply put, I realized that there are certain problems that tech just canâ€™t solve. Despite executives continually touting the success of AI-based systems to detect hate speech, I realized that Facebook was ultimately playing a reactionary game of whack-a-mole against endless QAnon extremist groups â€” the recent violent insurrection against the U.S. Capitol is just one more piece of evidence. And in the shadow of the House Judiciary Committeeâ€™s antitrust hearing last summer, I realized that nothing could eradicate the deeply entrenched power of todayâ€™s social media companies over every aspect of Americansâ€™ lives â€” short of a complete reimagining of our economic system itself.</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m a technologist at heart, and I donâ€™t deny that technology can help alleviate some of our problems. However, I now believe that policy, rather than technology, is the most effective tool to solve structural problems in a way that leaves a lasting impact. Wi-Fi sensors can help reduce vacant property fires in low-income neighborhoods, and this technology is important, but structural change requires us to reverse our countryâ€™s legacy of redlining and segregation in housing and transit policy. Facebookâ€™s burgeoning civic integrity teams can help reduce misinformation, but they donâ€™t tackle the root cause of the problem, which instead lies in the fracturing of the information environment in our democracy â€” something that technology canâ€™t solve. More tech will create more problems, and thoughtful tech can present solutions to isolated problems, but only policy change â€” when done with technologists at the table, of course â€” can meaningfully address structural injustice.</p>
    <p>Along the way, I've also tried to maintain my interest in the arts. I always carry my camera  around, because I never know when a good moment will strike. I'm a passionate transportation geek, and my go-to fun fact is that I can draw the New York City subway from heart.</p>
