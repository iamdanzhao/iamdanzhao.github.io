            <h2>My backstory</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="two-thirds home-bio">
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been a logical, numbers-driven person. I used to make spreadsheets for things that didn't need spreadsheets, including my wishlist to Santa one year. But the more I dabbled into debate and politics, the more I saw  that there's a lot more to our society than just numbers and equations. The 2016 election, and the subsequent debates on healthcare and immigration, fascinated me as much as it instilled in me a belief that despite all the talk of technology and innovation, public policy remains one of the most direct, impactful ways to improve people's everyday livelihoods.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've come to find the burgeoning intersection of technology, cities, policy, and governance as one fits my interests perfectly. In everything I do, I seek to bridge the divide between logical, evidence-based thinking and people-centered practice.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I've also tried to maintain my interest in the arts. I always carry my camera around, because I never know when a good moment will strike. I'm a passionate transportation geek, and my go-to fun fact is that I can draw the New York City subway from heart.</p>
