In the past two months, as I write the closing chapters of my college career, I’ve made what feels like two rather consequential decisions that will affect my trajectory going forward: deciding to turn down an offer to work at Facebook full-time, and deciding not to take another leave of absence and graduate in 2022. The first decision went more smoothly than the second, but in processing both I learned a lot about how I make decisions, gained a deeper sense of the things that are most important to me, and how I can streamline the process of making future decisions.

This post will articulate a set of considerations for when I make decisions in the future, as well as the values that underpin those considerations. I’m sharing this as a tool to hold myself accountable.

### Decisionmaking principles

What follows is eight principles that should guide all decisions I make. They’re not intended to serve as a checklist or hard rubric for making decisions, although it may be useful in some scenarios to use these guidelines has to compare two alternatives. More importantly, the principles below are meant to serve as a framework and, in some cases, a starting point for evaluating options presented to me.

These principles are very roughly ordered by importance. (Generally speaking: adjacent bullet points are probably roughly equally important; any farther, one item is roughly more important than the other.)

1. **Follow my gut instinct**. Thinking too much about the pros and cons of a decision will create questions and doubt in what I previously thought to be the right option, leading me to lose confidence and conviction in whichever course of action I decide to take.
2. Make decisions that are **based on my values**. See below.
3. Make decisions that are **based on my own goals and desires, not those of others.** At the end of the day, only I fully understand grasp my own goals and motivations and only I am responsible for my own success or failure. And I shouldn’t assume how others will react to a decision: they may end up much more favorable to it than I expect — so, leading up to a decision, I should care less about what others will think.
4. Make decisions that **maximize my ability to strengthen personal relationships and improve those around me**. A comment on a New York Times story (unfortunately, I can’t find the article right now) puts it best: there’s a difference *“between your career resume and your obituary resume. Because they never talk about your big deals, long hours, awards, or recognition. They talk about who you were as a person, what you contributed to your family, friends and community, how you may have made a difference in someone’s life or what a great friend you were.”*
5. Make decisions that **maximize my impact on people and problems.** This means spending time on the things that matter the most, equitably strengthening communities of which I am a part, positively impacting the people in my life, and keeping my eyes set on the most systemic problems.
6. Make decisions that **maximize my personal character growth**. This includes (but is certainly not limited to) surrounding myself with people I look up to and aspire to be like, as well as putting myself in new situations and experiences that challenge my skills and character.
7. Make decisions that **maximize my professional success**. (Despite being so low in this list, professional goals and success can tie into some of the criteria above. But pure career advancement, recognition, or prestige by itself should never be the primary driver of a decision.)
8. Make decisions that **maximize the diversity of lived experiences I can have**. Don’t do something (or not do something) if I know I’ll live to regret it — particularly when it’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

When I’ve made a decision using the **best available information** to me at that time and **in accordance with these principles**, I don’t have to regret any of my past decisions.

### Driving values and beliefs

These five ideas underpin my worldview, in turn shaping my actions and beliefs. A few are based on my experiences and training; others are more deep-rooted beliefs I hold, for which I’m still in the process of reflecting and identifying their origins.

- **Integrity**: **Integrity, honesty, and hard work** will lead to better personal, professional, and societal outcomes.
- **Accountability: Accountability fosters better outcomes**. Personally, this means that I need systems in place that will ensure I deliver on goals and expected outcomes. Socially, this means that the provision of goods and services is most effective when provided by institutions that are held accountable by the people they serve.
- **Duty**: **We each have a duty to improve the society we live in.** There are no shortage of problems in our society, but there a dire shortage of people working on them — and even fewer working on the most impactful ones. The more privilege we enjoy in our lives and the more resources that our loved ones, our communities, and our society have collectively invested in our lives, the greater the individual responsibility we have to tackle these important problems and give back to those who have given to us.
- **Public institutions**: **Strong, accountable public institutions are most prepared** and able to enact change on society’s most systemic problems and right the most deep-rooted injustices. Private enterprises have their place, but there must ultimately exist a balance of power between private and public institutions.
- **“Empirical humanism”**: **Numbers rarely tell the entire story**, and straightforward explanations and solutions for problems are often difficult to come by. Listening to people and listening to data are equally important.

### Lessons I’ve learned along the way

In reviewing my journal entries (primarily those from the past four years of college), here are a few things I’ve learned about myself that I need to keep in mind moving forward.

- I’ve been terrible at setting goals and achieving that, and I need to change that. I can deliver outcome when I have a clear goal in mind and make decisions anchored to those goals.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for things. I was raised in a way where I’ve been conditioned to not ask for things, to accept what others want from me, but that needs to change if I want to be content with my own life.
- I don’t need to be self-sufficient in everything I do. It’s okay to ask others for help and guidance, especially when I’m first entering new spaces and transitioning to new environments.
- I need to be confident in what I’m doing, and I need to be confident in my identity, character, skills, and beliefs.
- Despite the academic environment in which I’ve been immersed for the past sixteen years, my self-worth is based on far more than my self-perceived success and achievements.
- Comparing myself to others is healthy when it serves as a motivator; it’s unhealthy when I use a comparison to judge my self-worth. Character and identity is complex, and simple comparisons often disregard much nuance.
- **If I work as hard as I can in everything I do given the hand of cards that I’m dealt—in other words, if I make decisions based on all available information and in accordance with my values, based on my specific circumstances—then I give permission to myself to be content with my accomplishments and outcomes.**
