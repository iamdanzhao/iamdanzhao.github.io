## Projects {#projects}

### Statistics & data science

{:.list-plus}
- **Conducted a randomized field experiment** on whether using photos in text messages increases link click-through rates. We found no significant effect of including a picture versus not including one. We used `Twilio` (via Python API) to send SMS messages, `Rebrandly` (via Python API) to generate unique trackable links, and `R` for analysis and visualization. Final project for S&DS 315: Measuring Impact, Prof. Josh Kalla. [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zMFYqGpCuJ-gEAoDZafG6VLL2PQxQe_b/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel pink-block"} [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qjBd1igY0IjrU7NS7eUP02LMKwQGF-yPGUnW_CZ_MUg/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel pink-block"} [GitHub](https://github.com/iamdanzhao/teatexts){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel ghpurple-block"}
- **Applied natural language processing on news articles to track the US-China trade war**. We scraped White House press releases and Chinese state media articles in order to apply sentiment analysis and LDA topic modeling, demonstrating that sentiment often moves in tandem with key developments in the trade war. Used `selenium` and `BeautifulSoup` in Python for scraping, `dplyr` and `ggplot2` in R for analysis and visualization, and `topicmodels` in R for topic modeling. Final project for GLBL 849: Big Data & Global Policy, Prof. Casey King. [GitHub](https://github.com/iamdanzhao/maketradenotwar){:target="_blank" class="button ilabel ghpurple-block"}

### Reference

#### Data science

{:.description}
I've attempted to document my technical learnings over the past few years by creating reference guides. They're incomplete and I'm constantly adding to them, but perhaps they'll be useful:

#### Course notes

{:.description}
These are **notes I've compiled for courses I've taken**, as a study and review tool. Feel free to use at your own discretion, although I make no guarantees for the accuracy of the notes or the degree to which they will represent the course as taught in future semesters.
