<span class="home-title">Hi! I'm <span class="blue">Daniel</span> ðŸ‘‹</span>
<span class="home-subtitle">Iâ€™m a senior at Yale studying <span class="blue">data science and global affairs</span>. I'm passionate about leveraging data, technology, and public policy as a force for good.</span>

<p class="home-blurb">This fall, I'm taking a gap semester to intern at the <strong><a href="http://techtalentproject.org">Tech Talent Project</a></strong>, which works to recruit technical leaders to serve in government.</p>
    
<div class="home-pills">More about me</div>

<p class="home-blurb">Previously, I interned at <strong>Facebook</strong> on the product navigation data science team, served as a <a href="https://www.codingitforward.com/fellowship" style="font-weight: 600">2019 Civic Digital Fellow</a> at the <a href="https://blog.codingitforward.com/meet-the-2019-fellows-bureau-of-labor-statistics-db727bd7edfc" style="font-weight: 600">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>, and worked on local government innovation at <a href="https://medium.com/louisville-metro-opi2/data-driven-governance-reflecting-on-opi2-bdd324aefbdc" target="_blank"><strong>Louisville's Office of Civic Innovation</strong></a>.</p>

<p class="home-blurb">On campus, I founded and led the <a href="http://data.yaledailynews.com/"><strong>Yale Daily News' data team</strong></a>, where we use open datasets to <strong>investigate campus issues</strong> and <strong>produce interactive data visualizations</strong>. Before that, I also led a policy research team with the <strong>Yale Roosevelt Institute.</strong></p>

<p class="home-blurb">I'm passionate about tech policy, civic tech, data visualization, public transit, and the future of mobility. I believe that public institutions need to play a key role in addressing many of society's most pressing challenges. And, despite being a statistics major, I believe that numbers seldom capture the entire story.</p>

            <h2>My backstory</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="two-thirds home-bio">
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been a logical, numbers-driven person. I used to make spreadsheets for things that didn't need spreadsheets, including my wishlist to Santa one year. But the more I dabbled into debate and politics, the more I saw  that there's a lot more to our society than just numbers and equations. The 2016 election, and the subsequent debates on healthcare and immigration, fascinated me as much as it instilled in me a belief that despite all the talk of technology and innovation, public policy remains one of the most direct, impactful ways to improve people's everyday livelihoods.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've come to find the burgeoning intersection of technology, cities, policy, and governance as one fits my interests perfectly. In everything I do, I seek to bridge the divide between logical, evidence-based thinking and people-centered practice.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I've also tried to maintain my interest in the arts. I always carry my camera around, because I never know when a good moment will strike. I'm a passionate transportation geek, and my go-to fun fact is that I can draw the New York City subway from heart.</p>
