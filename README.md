# Personal website

This site was hand-built using HTML/CSS and Jekyll. Check it out at [danielzhao.com](http://danielzhao.com).

It's meant to provide a solution that's relatively simple to code, easy to maintain, and visually pleasing. You can feel free to fork this repo and customize the template for your own purposes â€” at some point I plan on making a guide for using the codebase, though I haven't quite gotten around to that just yet.
